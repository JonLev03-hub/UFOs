With the introduction of the space force into the US military it seems aliens may very well be a force to be wreckened with; I know many of my friends are searching for information on signtings. I have decsigned a basic website to showcase data on UFO sightings with basic filtering. The main functionality is to be able to sort through the UFO sighting data easily with the click of a button. 

## How to filter the data

Shown above is an image of the website, displaying the filtering features along with a table on the right side. By default it displays all the data in the json file attached, but to filter through the data you simply need to input the desired filters into the form on the left side. The form automatically updates so if you add or remove filters you dont need to worry about hitting submit or reloading the site. 

## Future Improvement 

The main drawback of the website is the actual data loaded into it. Currently most of the data is old, and could use for a good update so we could have uptodate information. 

Improvements that would make a great addition to the website are a heatmap for all the locations where the sightings occure; this would allow the users to easily read and access the data with nice visualization. I would also love to add the ability to scrape new data from different sites so you can be up to date on all the sightings and even have news that is relavant to UFO sightings such as the UFO task force that was created by the pentagon as of 08/04/2020.
